## INTRODUCTION
Internet of Things (IoT) technology, are today part of our lives and most evident in every major facet of our lives of which health institutions are not left out. In hospital emergency wards, the severity of tasks posed serious health risks to patients. Patient management when achieved through conventional methods generally result in management breakdowns. Hence, there is a degradation in the performance of efficient management approaches. Many healthcare institutions in Nigeria suffer from a plethora of inefficiencies and dysfunctions. Though the Government and individuals are putting much effort into (new hospitals, rehabilitations of old ones, training of new physicians among other things), but the problem still persists and medical staff, patients and globally health system are severely affected. Because of the aforementioned, this study is carried out to consider the impact of IOT to health institutions in clinical data management, and as such variables that are principally linked to mismanagement of health related activities, equipment, human and material resources will be reveal. Sabooniha, Toohey and Lee (2012) in their study determined the influence of human resource management on the improvement of healthcare delivery in public hospitals and discovered that good management leads to a better healthcare delivery quality. Other similar studies include that of Pocztowski (2010). Jończyk (2015) was of the opinion that it is necessary to note that the artifacts used during work are essentially limited to Excel paper sheets, which are often not updated and sometimes even get lost between the different services. This problem exists as a result of the excessive yet crucial work volume imposed on the personnel, which decreases the efficiency of work and healthcare delivery quality. Inasmuch the lofty aim of every healthcare organizations is to provide cost effective, high quality, shared and seamless healthcare delivery, they need to reduce medical errors, safeguard patients’ data and streamline clinical and administrative tasks is very much important. The numerous studies that have been carried on this issue have almost shown the importance of management and management breakdowns among the medical staff members that inevitably have an impact on the quality of care provided to patients and put them in a potentially vulnerable and dangerous situation (Sabooniha, Toohey & Lee, 2012).

In this paper, there is need to consider the Governance, Risk and Compliance approach (GRC) coupled with Internet of Things technology (IoT) called tGRC. This study is done to help provide a set of tools that may effectively address core medical needs and improve the quality of patients’ care. One can propose an effective support enabling management features of the related tasks as well as providing an efficient data collection in real time awareness around the occurring events; particularly those which constitute a priority in any health institution. We led a study in a Nigerian maternity ward to comprehend the methodology in which medical activities are achieved by medical staff like midwives, gynecologists-obstetricians, nurses, anesthetists etc. and to identify the principal artifacts in management and coordination. If for instance, one can begin by analyzing the way with which medical staff collect information, operate with different medical scenarios, and how they manage the work. It might be evident that the medical staffs are suffering under the load of all the procedural, intellectual and social complexity of the management process. Indeed, the heavily accumulated volume of data ought to be collected, processed and made available for appropriate use.
