## Effects of Burnout
The negative effects of burnout in students are similar to those found in earlier studies with human-service workers, such as low job or school attendance, decreased quality of work, and increased likelihood of quitting or dropping out (Law, 2007). In some cases, the effects of burnout may be more intense for students because most of the academic workload is handled outside the classroom, whereas paid work stressors are typically confined to the workplace (Law, 2007). Kuo et al. (2018) found that high levels of burnout led to avoidancecoping strategies, which were related to increased academic stress and negatively impacted academic success. Jacobs and Dodd (2003) further suggested that burnout was associated with negative temperament, insomnia, and increased drug and alcohol use. In addition, the long-term effects of burnout appear to extend to increased likelihood of dropping out of college, experiencing job burnout after college, developing cardiovascular disease, and developing hypertension (May et al., 2018; Peterka-Bonetta et al., 2019; Salmela-Aro et al., 2011). Although the environment in which burnout occurs is academic, its consequences appear to negatively impact many present and future aspects of life for students.

Because burnout is an amalgam of three different negative internal states (emotional exhaustion, cynicism and lack of self-efficacy), some effects of burnout are more strongly associated with certain constituent states. Jacobs and Dodd (2003) observed that emotional exhaustion was associated with negative temperament and higher perceived levels of workload. They also found that reduced selfefficacy was associated with lower perceived social support and less time spent in extracurricular activities. Cynicism toward studies has been more extensively studied in relation to its proposed opposite, which is optimism. Vizoso et al. (2019) concluded that optimism was negatively related to other dimensions of burnout and maladaptive coping strategies. More research is needed to clarify the unique effects of cynicism as a function of burnout, but emotional exhaustion and decreased self-efficacy both appear to pose threats to student well-being.

## Preventative and Coping Strategies in Formal Settings
The establishment of grassroots organizations like NAMI near the turn of the 21st Century and the rise of social media as a platform to speak openly about mental illness have contributed to the further establishment of mental health services (NAMI, 2020). But these services are relatively new, and schools are finding that their clinics are being overloaded with students requesting help, despite measures to expand staff (CCHM, 2020). These trends suggest that achieving healthy student populations may require a more sustainable approach than treating the afflicted.

Although academic burnout is linked to many harmful psychological and physiological disorders, it currently does not appear in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which suggests that students who experience academic burnout may not receive the help they need unless they exhibit symptoms for other illnesses that are more easily diagnosed (American Psychiatric Association Publishing, 2020). Fortunately, research about academic burnout has elucidated many predictive factors that could be used to form more effective prevention courses and targeted treatment programs. In order to reduce academic burnout, and consequently the prevalence of other mental illnesses on campus, schools should implement research-based preventative and curative programs like those used to teach soft skills in primary and secondary schools.

## Effectiveness of Internal Factors to Mediate Burnout
Many studies on academic burnout have shown that the demands students face and the experience of burnout are not directly correlated; instead, many internal factors and soft skills are thought to mediate the relationship between demands and burnout (Brissette et al., 2002; Chang et al., 2016; Woo Kyeong, 2013). Some students with demanding workloads and social pressures do not experience burnout, but instead experience engagement, which is “a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption” (Schaufeli et al., 2002b, p. 74). One popular theory as to why internal factors mediate demands and burnout is the demand-resource theory which was originally posed to explain work stress (Williams et al., 2018). In an academic context, students typically experience burnout when their personal resources are exhausted by their perceived demands. Factors studied by other researchers (such as motivation, attitude, and coping skills) tend to act as personal resources for students. Although most burnout studies do not focus on the theoretical origins, the research is rapidly growing in support of the impact of motivational style, personal attitude, and coping skills on predicting academic burnout.

## Motivation
Student motivational style has been shown to mediate the relationship between demands and burnout. Motivational styles have been operationalized in many ways, including the study of perfectionism, passion, and intrinsic or extrinsically located constructs. Stoeber et al. (2011) found that when students were passionately engaged in academic activities because they were personally fulfilling, they experienced decreased exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficiency. Chang et al. (2016) similarly indicated that students who reported acting on self-imposed perfectionism and high personal standards to achieve their goals experienced less burnout than students who felt their experience of perfectionism was socially prescribed. According to Rubino et al. (2009) intrinsic motivation was a protective factor against academic burnout, and external regulation significantly predicted exhaustion and cynicism. Motivation based on the personal importance of work is associated with less burnout, and externally prescribed motivation appears to increase the likelihood of burnout.

## Attitude
Attitude toward demands (such as academic workload or social obligations) is thought to act as a cognitive expression of motivational style and has been shown to predict the occurrence of burnout in students. The role of optimism in predicting mental illness is consistently found in research on burnout. According to Vizoso et al. (2019), optimism negatively predicted emotional exhaustion; similarly, Brissette et al. (2002) found that students who reported feeling high levels of optimism at the start of school experienced smaller increases in stress and depression over the course of a semester than their less optimistic peers. Although optimism does not typically decrease objective workload or eradicate psychological distress, it appears to have a clear mitigating effect. Research also indicates that a student’s appraisal of their workload is more closely related to burnout than their objective workload, which means that students who believe they have intense workloads are more likely to experience burnout than students who do not (Jacobs & Dodd, 2003). These findings suggest that attitude is a powerful mediator between demands and burnout because of the predictive significance of optimistic perspective.

## Coping
Both motivational style and attitude can be expressed behaviorally as coping mechanisms, which play a key role in predicting and preventing burnout. Adaptive and culturally appropriate coping strategies, coping flexibility, and practicing self-compassion all negatively predict burnout. According to Vizoso et al. (2019), adaptive coping strategies such as problem solving, cognitive restructuring, expressing emotions, and social support negatively predicted exhaustion and cynicism and positively predicted efficacy. However, what may be an adaptive coping mechanism in one situation could be maladaptive in another context, which highlights the role of coping flexibility (Gan et al., 2007). Students who can adjust their coping mechanisms depending on if their problem is mental, emotional, or social are also less likely to experience burnout (Gan et al., 2007). Coping flexibility is thought to be related to socio- or ethnocentric coping strategies, which are coping strategies that increase in-group connection and social acceptance because they reflect social norms (Kuo et al., 2018). Effective utilization of culturally relevant coping strategies has shown to decrease emotional exhaustion, which is a key component of burnout. Self-compassion, which is a form of adaptive cognitive restructuring, is also related to lower levels of burnout and increased psychological well-being (Woo Kyeong, 2013). Together, these findings suggest that burnout can be prevented as students learn adaptive coping strategies and understand when to appropriately use them.

## Teaching Burnout Prevention
There are unique barriers to teaching burnout prevention as an intervention program in college communities. If burnout intervention programs are structured as optional classes, it may be difficult for students to devote time, attention, and money to taking such optional credits due the academic rigor of college. Meta-analyses on burnout and stress psychoeducation programs also show that most programs are implemented in conjunction with work or primary-school attendance (Awa et al., 2010; Kragg et al., 2006). The nature of work and school environments is typically one of daily attendance with interactions between stable social groups, whereas college students interact more superficially with a wide variety of peers and authority figures, which could hinder implementation of a daily intervention program. 

Studies reviewing teaching methods and results of psychoeducational programs show that programs are generally effective in reducing stress and preventing burnout over time, and specific modifications to existing methodology could make programs successful for college students despite the aforementioned limitations (Awa et al., 2010; Kragg et al., 2006). In a meta-analysis conducted by Awa et al. (2010), skills commonly taught in burnout prevention programs included cognitive behavioral training, counseling, communication skill training, relaxation exercises, and social support skills. Successful psychoeducational programs typically depend on in-class education and at-home practice, so even if students do not have class time every day, their practice time implementing the soft skills learned in class can still be effective (Awa et al., 2010). Based on the research elucidating motivation, attitude, and coping skills as key mediating factors between demand and burnout, there is room for improvement to existing psychoeducational models. These modifications for burnout prevention teaching include addressing the importance of intrinsic motivation, healthy passion for achievement, optimism, self-compassion, and coping skills.
