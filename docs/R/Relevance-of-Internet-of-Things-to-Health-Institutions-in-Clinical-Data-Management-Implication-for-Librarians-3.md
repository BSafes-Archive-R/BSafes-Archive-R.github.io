The above diagram is a conceptual model for a health institution applications based on IoT. The model is founded on advanced enterprise systems (Benmerzoug, 2015) and those of the IoT domain (Haller, Serbanati, Bauer & Carrez, 2013). As seen, it is composed of domain entities and shows the interrelating pathways that can exist between those entities. A public process is the aggregation of the private processes and/or Web services participating in it. It can be noted here that private processes are considered as the set of processes of the organization itself and they are managed in an autonomous way to serve local needs. The public processes span organizational boundaries. They belong to the organizations involved in a collaboration relationship and have to be agreed and jointly managed by the different partners. The most generic IoT scenario is seen as a generic Agent (human or software component) needing to interact with a physical entity in our tangible world. Physical entities are represented in the digital world by a virtual entity. An IoT object (or a thing) is the composition of a virtual entity and the physical entity it is associated to, in order to highlight the fact that these two concepts belong together. One should realize that the device entity will often perform in a bi-directional manner with the “IoT object” at the edge of the network either acting as input devices (sensors) or output devices (actuators). Besides input and output devices, tags are used to identify physical entities, to which the tags are usually physically attached. The identification process is called “reading”, and it is carried out by specific sensor devices, which are usually called readers. The primary purpose of tags is to facilitate and increase the accuracy of the identification process. Public process (which is the aggregation of the private processes and/or web services participating in it) consumes resources. Resources are software components used in the actuation on physical entities. There is a distinction between on-device resources and network resources. As the name indicates, ondevice resources are hosted on devices (like software that is deployed locally on the device). They include executable code for accessing, processing, and storing sensor information, as well as code for controlling actuators. On the other hand, network resources are resources available wherein the network, e.g., back-end or cloud-based databases. A virtual entity can also be associated with resources that enable interaction with the physical entity that the virtual entity represents.

### Clinical Data Management
It is quite obvious that the amount of data generated in a hospital is voluminous as this information though sometimes proving innecessar is still much valued in forecasting, drawing a correlation and regression as well as real time monitoring. For example, if one is to look at the real time information of the blood pressure and temperature readings of a near comatose patient, its much evident one would tire from all the cumbersome data. Hence in order to effectively and efficiently use this information all processes will require rigorous execution for a better result, the following becomes imperative.

**Quality Assurance (QA)** in this processes are ensuring that the clinical data presented and interpreted in the clinical study report reflect a true picture of what took place in the trial. While according to ICH GCP definition QA include all those planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure that the trial is performed and the ‘clinical’ data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (Benmerzoug, 2015). It is necessary that clinical data management have written procedures in place which will allow an independent group to audit against the actual processes taking place in the handling of clinical data. The documentation detailing what has happened during that operation should be present. The presence of a QA group is perceived as of marginal importance, certainly in the view of senior management. However, there is no doubt that the inclusion of quality in the culture of a company or organisation is a requirement of any operation conducting clinical operations. The last principle of ICH GCP requires that there are ‘systems with procedures that assure the quality of every aspect of the trial’ (Rondel, Varley & Webb, 2020).

**Quality Control (QC)** based on The definition in the ICH GCP definitional guidelines for QC is the operational techniques and activities undertaken within the quality assurance system to verify the requirements for quality of the trial-related activities have been fulfilled (Benmerzoug, 2015). It explains the necessity of clinical data management having documented evidence of what so ever activity has been carried out through any clinical operation ensuring the quality of the clinical data. QC tasks are the responsibility of the personnel handling the clinical data. In some cases, most often group designated within clinical data management to conduct these tasks.

**Audit** is a systematic and independent examination of trial related activities and documents to determine whether the evaluated trial related activities were conducted, and the ‘clinical’ data were recorded, analysed and accurately reported according to the protocol, sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (Benmerzoug, 2015). A necessary audit plan is much needed and the main scope should be recorded in the resulting audit report. Normally, key questions will have been listed before the audit has commenced and the auditor should be encouraged to restrict his/her attention to the audit’s scope.

**Performance** defines a measure of fitness for purpose and can be used as an overall measure of quality and productivity or work rate. We will be looking at three primary performance indicators, *productivity, quality and process cycle times*. In performance, a *standardized* set of process tasks must be clearly defined. The data management process flow is changing and developing quickly as new technology is introduced to the data collection process. It is difficult to consistently define the process flow as there is often much variation across organisations, clinical phases and therapeutic areas. However, in order to define comprehensive performance standards, it is critical our measurement tools on a common set of processes within data management which can be consistently interpreted across clinical phases, therapeutic areas and indeed organizations. It is therefore important to define the work flow process in clinical data management using IOT.
