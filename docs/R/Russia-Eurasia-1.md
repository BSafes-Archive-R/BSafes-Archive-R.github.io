## I. Corporate Law
In 2016, Russian law underwent several changes aimed at modernizing its corporate legal framework and implementing the results of recent civil law reforms. The major changes related to (a) the transfer of participation interests in a limited liability company; (b) approving major and relatedparty transactions; (c) record-keeping regarding beneficial owners; (d) the so-called "Fourth Antimonopoly Package;" and (e) judicial case law.

### A. TRANSFER OF PARTICIPATION INTERESTS IN AN LLC

The rules pertaining to transferring participation interests in a Russian LLC were revised to curb malicious corporate raiding.<sup>1</sup> First, as of January 1, 2016, a participation interest is deemed transferred when a corresponding entry is made in the public register, whereas previously, transfer occurred upon notarization of the transaction. This procedural change impacts the drafting of purchase agreements, particularly provisions allocating risks prior to transfer. Second, certain corporate actions became subject to public notary certification, including (1) resolutions to increase a company's charter capital; (2) a participant's notice to withdraw from a company; (3) an offer to sell a participation interest to a third party; and (4) a participant's request for a company to buy out its participation interest.

Third, the structure of option agreements for participation interests was clarified and improved. As of January 15, 2016, an option agreement for a participation interest may be exercised through a notarized irrevocable offer, which an offeree can subsequently accept through unilateral notarized acceptance. This limits the risk that the offeror changes its mind after granting the option but before the actual transfer.

### B. APPROVAL OF AJOR AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Effective January 1, 2017, new regulations for major and related-party transactions narrowed the scope of transactions subject to approval.<sup>2</sup> The definition of "major transactions" changed from a firm threshold of twentyfive percent of the corporate assets' book value to a more sophisticated criterion. Specifically, a transaction is now considered "maor" and subject to approval if it both (1) results in the termination of the company's business or changes the type or scale of its business; and (2) exceeds twenty-five percent of the company's assets' book value.

With respect to related-party transactions, the new law abolished the requirement of prior approval by non-related participants and shifted the focus to reporting and subsequent control. In addition, whether a party is "related" to a transaction will no longer require only a twenty percent or more "affiliation" with the relevant company.<sup>3</sup> Instead, the new rules require "control" of the relevant company, defined as controlling more than fifty percent of the governing body's votes and appointing the sole executive body and/or more than fifty percent of the collective management body.<sup>4</sup> In practical terms, this significantly decreases the number of related-party

transactions subject to pre-approval. Further, the law now requires companies to notify their boards or shareholders of a contemplated relatedparty transaction at least fifteen days in advance.

The rules for challenging major transactions and related-party transactions were also amended. To bring a claim, a shareholder (or group of shareholders) must hold no less than one percent of the company's share capital. Practitioners view this change as a limitation on minority shareholders' rights, since there was no such threshold before.

### C. RECORDS OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS

As of December 21, 2016, Russian companies are required to identify and keep records on their beneficial owners.<sup>5</sup> A beneficial owner is defined as a person who ultimately owns, either directly or indirectly, a participation interest of more than twenty-five percent of an organization's share capital, or is able to control its actions. Russian companies are now required to: (1) undertake all reasonable and available measures to obtain information on the company's beneficial owners, including the owners' complete names, citizenships, dates of birth, passport data, copies of immigration documents (if applicable), addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers; (2) update such information at least once a year; (3) retain such information for a minimum of 5 years; <sup>6</sup> and (4) provide supporting documents upon the request of relevant governmental authorities. This duty of identification is enforced through newly introduced penalties of up to RUB 500,000 (approximately $8,000 USD) for failure to comply.<sup>7</sup>

### D. "FOURTH ANTimONOPOLY PACKAGE"

Another set of legal changes pertains to antimonopoly (antitrust) law. The so-called "Fourth Antimonopoly Package"<sup>8</sup> took effect on January 5, 2016

Specifically, joint venture agreements between competitors are now subject to prior approval of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) if they meet standard merger control monetary thresholds. Also, merger control filings are meant to be more transparent, and, as such, the FAS is required to disclose on its official website certain information about transactions for which a request for approval has been submitted. Interested third parties now may submit statements relating to transactions under review and their impact on competition.

### E. FURTHER CASE LAW DEVELOPMENTS

The positive legislative changes described above have been accompanied by valuable clarifications from the courts, a few of which are worthy of mention. In a seminal case, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed for the first time that failure to vote in a manner agreed upon in a shareholders' agreement may result in contractual penalties.<sup>9</sup> Prior to this decision, it was unclear whether a court would enforce a monetary penalty for the breach of a contractual duty to vote or act in a particular way. In fact, this was one of the first times that the Supreme Court interpreted any of the new provisions for corporate agreements that were introduced in mid-2014. In another case, the Supreme Court allowed a company's ultimate beneficiaries (i.e., those owning shares indirectly through a chain of foreign companies) to challenge corporate resolutions of the company's Russian subsidiaries in Russian national courts. <sup>10</sup> Previously, only direct shareholders could do so, which deprived ultimate beneficiaries of operational control over their subsidiaries.
