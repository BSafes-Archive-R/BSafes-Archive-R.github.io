## V. Data Privacy and Religious Freedom Law in Russia
On July 6, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law new counter-terrorism legislation commonly referred to as the "Yarovaya Law"<sup>114</sup> after its principal sponsor, arch-conservative senator Irina Yarovaya. The Yarovaya Law amended existing Russian federal laws on data retention and added restrictions on religious freedom. Most of the amendments took effect on July 20, 2016, although some (such as those relating to storage of metadata) will not take effect until July 1, 2018.<sup>115</sup>

### A. TELECOMMUNICATIONS PORTION OF YAROVAYA LAW

The amendments regarding telecommunications require "telecom providers" and "Internet arrangers"'<sup>116</sup> to: 

1. Allow access to communicated information (such as telephone calls, email messages, text messages, etc.) by Russian government investigators and prosecutors;

Communication services include "[r]eceiving, processing, storing, transferring or delivering any physical or electronic communications," and provision of such services usually requires a license under Russian law.

The term "Internet arranger" is defined as "a person ensuring the functioning of information systems and/or software used to receive, transmit, deliver, and/or process electronic messages of Internet users" (e.g., social media).

2. Stop providing communication services to any user who fails to respond to a request by investigators or prosecutors to confirm that user's identity; 

3. Maintain inside the Russian Federation: 

a. For three years (in the case of telecom companies) or one year (for Internet providers), the metadata information confirming transmission, receipt, delivery, and processing of voice data, text messages, pictures, video, sound, or other communications; 

b. For six months, the actual contents of such communications. <sup>117</sup>

In addition, the law requires providers to supply any other information "which is necessary for these authorities to achieve their statutory goals" and to assist the authorities with decoding the data provided.1'1 Violation of these provisions can result in an administrative fine of up to one million rubles.'<sup>119</sup> Arguably, failure to maintain or provide more than one communication (e.g., several emails) could be viewed as multiple violations, but this is yet to be tested.

An uproar ensued over the passage of these provisions on legal, technical, and financial grounds. One of the major controversies surrounding the Yarovaya Law is that it appears to extend to all telecom or Internet providers who facilitate any communication to or from Russia, thus encompassing foreign providers such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and many others.<sup>120</sup> Many of these companies are located in countries that forbid, on privacy grounds, the tracking and maintenance of certain communications covered by the Russian law (such as telephone calls), putting these global providers in a position of having to violate either their own country's laws or Russian law (if they are to continue operating in Russia).<sup>121</sup> One western operator, Private Internet Access, immediately discontinued its business in Russia upon passage of the law for this reason.<sup>122</sup>

<sup>117</sup>. The requirement that contents of communications be stored for six months will take effect on July 1, 2018 (or possibly July 1, 2023, if a current draft law seeking such postponement is passed). Koroleva, *supra* note 115.

### B. RELIGIOUS PORTION OF YAROVAYA LAW

The Yarovaya Law also places restrictions on religious activities outside of designated places of worship.<sup>123</sup> The amendments to Russia's Religion Law <sup>124</sup> require that "missionary activity" be done "without hindrance" only at churches and other religious sites designated by the chapter, and that it is expressly forbidden to perform missionary activities in private homes. "Missionary activity" is defined as

> the activity of a religious association, aimed at disseminating information about its beliefs among people who are not participants in that religious association, with the purpose of involving these people as participants. It is carried out directly by religious associations or by citizens and/or legal entities authorized by them, publicly, with the help of the media, the internet or other lawful means. <sup>125</sup>

Missionary activities may be performed only by authorized members of registered religious groups and organizations. Thus, only state-registered religious groups and organizations may engage in such religious expression.<sup>126</sup> The amendments prohibit even the informal sharing of beliefs, such as responding to a question, by individuals.<sup>127</sup> Citizens are required to report unauthorized religious activity to the government or face fines.<sup>128</sup> The law also increases the punishment for those engaging in "extremist" activity, a term used to prosecute Muslims and Jehovah's Witnesses.<sup>129</sup>
