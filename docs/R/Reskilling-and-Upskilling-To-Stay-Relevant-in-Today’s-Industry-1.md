## Introduction
As stated in the report on the future of jobs by the World Economic Forum in 2018, around 75 million jobs will be lost in 20 major economies by the turn of the coming year. At the same time, all of these technological advancements and ongoing digital transformation are predicted to result in the creation of 133 million new jobs. Companies that rely heavily on operations have come into a new era of automation and digitization. This in turn has a significant impact on the talents they will require in order to stay competitive. It is primarily lower-skilled jobs that are being replaced by machinery and automation. If a firm which is mainly production line based does not replace human labor that does the repetitive tasks with newer technology, it is bound to suffer a loss as a result of competition from other companies that have a clear cut advantage using them. Hence, it is impossible for major businesses to stay away from technological advancements. Low-skilled employees will be the most at risk to lose their employment as a result of this change. Technology helps in boosting productivity, easing the strain on human labour, and eliminating their need to do repetitive activities. Workers will need to learn newer and up to date skills in order to stay employed. All that is required is that people receive training for the newly established job roles. We can take advantage of the influence of technology on jobs if the government takes care of reskilling low-skilled employees. Many tasks that once required humans can now be completed by machines thanks to technological advancements. Many researchers on the subject have the forecast that the fourth industrial revolution or the second machine age will have a disruptive impact on the way we work with technology and on the general workforce. Brynjolfsson and McAfee say, “technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead”. And so, one can say that now is the worst time to work with regular abilities as digital technologies are gaining the capability to do the same at an astounding rate [Bissell 2020]. In the future years, the automation revolution will have a significant impact on employment. Almost every profession will change, many of them drastically, and the vast majority of the present workforce will need to learn new skills. Preparation to meet future demands is a vital assessment for businesses but is seldom thought about. The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the shift to the automation revolution due to restrictions as well as increased demand. Companies are responding to this crisis by entering a world of physical separation in the workplace and significant shifts in customer behavior and expectations. Organizations are being forced to rethink their operations in order to prepare for the new normal. Companies in the manufacturing industry are reorganizing their supply and production chains. Digital customer experiences and smart or contactless operations are becoming more important to service firms. These developments will have a considerable impact on workforce skill and capability requirements, ranging from dramatic increases in home and remotely-based work to the need for shop-floor staff to learn new skills and revise newer health and safety regulations. Manufacturing, transportation, and retail, as well as operations-related vocations like maintenance, claims, warehouse order processing and picking, will see more change than the worldwide average since they frequently employ large numbers and because many operational duties are predictable and repetitive, they are well-suited to automation or digitalization. This will and has very rapidly been noticed to give rise to skills gaps which is basically the difference between the kind of skills that employers need for the employees to possess and the skills that the job seekers or employees actually possess [Gallie 1991]. With the technological change of jobs in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, more than 1 billion people must be retrained by 2030. It is estimated that by 2022, the basic skills required for 42% of existing jobs will change and now is the time to understand the importance of getting reskilled and upskilled if one needs to retain his position at workplace [Zahidi 2020].
