## Conceptualizing Burnout
The concept of burnout is closely related to stress and mental illness and has recently gained attention in the literature for its harmful effects on young adults. Student burnout is typically measured through self-completion of the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Student Survey (MBI–SS), which measures emotional exhaustion, cynicism toward schoolwork, and lack of self-efficacy or inability to successfully meet academic demands (Schaufeli et al., 2002b). Researchers do not agree on how long it takes for students to experience burnout or if their year of school (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) matters for burnout score. Studies have been conducted at the beginning of the school term, at the halfway mark, and the week before finals, with first through fourth year students in undergraduate programs, and even with medical students (Jacobs & Dodd, 2003; Law, 2007; McLuckie et al., 2018). Students reported significant levels of burnout in a variety of settings and times in the school year, suggesting that the causes of burnout can be attributed to more than present scholastic pressures and that its effects may extend after the school year is over.
