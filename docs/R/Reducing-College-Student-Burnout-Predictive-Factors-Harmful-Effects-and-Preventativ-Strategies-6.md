## Conclusion
Though the pseudonymous @CollegeStudent attributes all their problems to the academic rigor and various pressures of student life, it is more accurate to state that they are suffering from a lack of personal resources to handle their demands and, consequently, are experiencing burnout. Social media platforms such as Twitter let students share their school stress with people who can relate, but this practice may ultimately contribute to the rise of student burnout because the roots of the problem, such as attitude, motivation, and coping skills, are internal. 

The young adult years, including the college years, are typically dynamic and demanding, which is thought to contribute to increased susceptibility for burnout. Young adults are typically more stressed than older adults and are likely in the process of making decisions with lifelong consequences such as choosing a career path or selecting a life partner (APA, 2012). During the college years, young adults are more likely to develop mental illness than at any other stage in life, which may lead to developing unhealthy habits or coping skills later (NAMI, 2019). Young adult psychological and physiological challenges, with the additional demands of being a student, may contribute to the risk and prevalence of burnout, which appears to have harmful short- and long-term effects on academic and professional careers as well as on mental and physical health.

Campus psychological services and options, such as wellness and recreational courses, can help students who experience mental illness, but there are few services to prevent burnout (which is often a precursor to mental illness), and they would be most effective if built on the research about the relationship between demands and burnout. Students are increasingly requesting psychological services, especially for anxiety and depressive disorders, so implementing programs that could keep students out of curative services may help reduce the patient load of campus psychologists (CCMH, 2020). By implementing mandatory courses to educate students on the predictors of burnout and by teaching them to develop the soft skills that control how they process demands, university educators may create healthier campus communities and more successful alumni in the workplace.

Although the demands that college students typically face ultimately allow them to experience new challenges that are important to the process of becoming financially, socially, and emotionally self-sufficient, these young adults are a vulnerable population psychologically and deserve resources to teach them how to manage the novel and intense demands of adulthood. Research shows that students can be healthily engaged with many life demands, and those who are intrinsically motivated, optimistic, and use adaptive coping strategies flexibly are more likely to avoid burnout than those who do not understand their role in handling demands successfully (Gan et al., 2007; Rubino et al., 2009; Vizoso et al., 2019). If students are educated as part of their university curriculum about how to develop the soft skills to avoid burnout, they are more likely to be psychologically and physiologically healthy and successful in college and in the workforce.

Research on college student burnout is relatively new, which means there are limitations that may affect the application of findings and there is room for future studies. Many studies on burnout were conducted on undergraduate populations even though burnout has also been identified in graduate school students, so it is possible that different mediating factors between demands and distress exist at different levels of one’s educational career (McLuckie et al., 2018). Researchers may also use different surveys to measure burnout besides the MBI–SS, which variation could contribute to varying interpretation of results.

Universities most often address stress through relief programs or services. As schools move to prevention models of treatment, effective practices can be synthesized into existing hypothetical models of effective burnout-prevention courses or programs. Although the research supporting prevention programs is still growing, conclusions thus far are consistent: burnout tends to be pervasive on campuses and detrimental to student health, and it can be effectively reduced with the right preventative strategies.
