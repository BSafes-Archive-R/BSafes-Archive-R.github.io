## 5. Conclusion 
This study examined the readers’ perception and preference for online and print newspapers in the university library. From the result, online newspapers will continue gain more readership but will certainly not replace their print versions. In as much as the news contents of both sources are reliable and trusted, some readers still prefer print newspapers due to the feeling they derive from it. As rightly said by various researchers, proliferation in information technologies may increase patronage of online news sources but may not lead to total annihilation of the print newspapers. In Nigeria universities, print newspapers will continue to strive especially among the older users since most of the old people are less conversant with Information Technologies compare to younger people.
