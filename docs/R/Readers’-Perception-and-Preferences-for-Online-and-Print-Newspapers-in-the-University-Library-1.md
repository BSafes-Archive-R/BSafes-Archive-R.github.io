## 1. Introduction
University libraries remain a vibrant hub for both staff, students and faculty members who congregate daily to get updated with current happenings in the society through newspaper publications – either print or online. Print newspapers are published on a daily or weekly basis, and are meant to inform the general public about recent events, especially public affairs. In addition to local, national or international news, newspapers also carry sports and entertainment features, opinion columns and advertising. Print media industry experiences changes as a result of advancement in technology especially new media [1]. The revolution witnessed in the print media industry has been more conspicuous now than any time in the print media history globally [2]. New technologies have brought myriads of challenges to print newspapers in the 21st century.

Newspaper is referred to as one of the periodical or serials publication issued at regular and usually close intervals, especially daily or weekly containing news, comment, features, and advertising. In the modern age, newspaper can take the form of print and online. The print newspaper has been existing for decades before the advent of online news occasioned by the Information Communication Technologies. Print newspaper refers to newspapers that are produced in hard copies using ink and paper [3].

On the other hand, an online newspaper, also refers to as a web newspaper, is a daily newspaper that is published and read over the World Wide Web or Internet. It can be an individual daily that is available online only or it could be an online version of a printed periodical [4].

Readers, in the context of this study, include individuals or group of people who read a particular newspaper. In the university library, readers include the students, staff, faculty and members of the university Community. [5b] asserted that online newspapers are among the resources that a university library provides for the users.

With the advent of Information Communication Technologies, newspaper publications are no longer limited to print edition but also made available online. This new phenomenon must have untold consequences on the preference of readership among the users. Currently, newspaper agencies make use of the World Wide Web (www) among other services of the net to create and maintain web servers in which they publish contents of their papers. The increased use of the World Wide Web in universities is a vital component of the Information Communication Technologies. Through this, the library subscribes to online news sources which are made available to users [6], [7b].

The flourishing of newspapers and magazines online may not be unconnected with some possible secondary reasons- including enthusiasm for new technology and the general sense that one wishes to be part of the new wave at the moment not minding the adverse consequences. In a study conducted in [8], it was discovered that media technologies which is more impressive and efficient in dissemination of information have continued to replace print methods of information delivery more rapidly. It was also discovered in [1] that in the digital age, online news is instantly disseminated, posing challenges to print news. As a result, most newspapers integrated the Internet for more quicker and accessible news.

The surge in the introduction of new and better information tools, courtesy the advent of Information Communication Technology has increasingly complemented and replaced older print tools of mass information. New media delivery systems, new information processing, storage and retrieval systems, and readership pattern have irresistibly dominated the communication scene. An online newspaper is the online version of a newspaper, either as a stand-alone publication or as the online version of a printed periodical. Going online created more opportunities for newspapers, such as competing with broadcast journalism in presenting breaking news in a timelier manner. However, the advent of the Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) has changed the patronage level of the mainstream media (Newspaper, Radio and Television), especially the Newspaper, which has been the oldest among the trio. The average age of today’s newspaper reader is 53, and that newspapers are making frantic efforts to connect with today’s increasing distracted and time-pressed younger readers [9].

The current struggle between the two formats of newspaper production brought a question as to whether newspapers are losing gross audience, or the audience is simply shifting online; or whether the online and print audiences differ. Another question is whether newspaper sites are performing relative to other online news outlet [10].

It was observed that print editions of newspapers struggle with declining readership and advertising revenue. On the other hand, the online newspapers, while growing modestly, fails to fill the void on the more important metric of revenue. While examining the growth in online newspaper site visitors relative to the decline in print readership audiences, and to what degree readers of the print edition, it was observed in [11] that the accessibility of online newspaper content has declining impact on the readership of its print counterpart, as the online version satisfies readers’ needs for information. A number of related studies have conducted in Nigeria, mainly in the west, south, and north regions of the country. But little or no scholarly attention is given to the readers’ perception and preferences for print and online newspapers, particularly in the Southeast, which is the focus of this study. This study aims to examine the readers' perception and preferences, and determine the extent to which online newspaper reading affects the readership of its print versions in Rhema University Library, Nigeria.

### *1.1 Statement of the problem*
Newspapers have since the advent of online newspapers, courtesy the platform provided the technology of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has been undergoing some salient challenges, as far as readers’ patronage is concern. This scenario is capable of forcing the print newspaper out of circulation if concrete steps are not taken. It has been observed in the university library that the number of readers of print newspapers across the world is declining rapidly in the past year, while the total number of visitors to the online newspapers sites is increasing. However, the decline in the number of print readers is far higher than the increase in the number of online newspaper readers in the university library. With the state of readership of both newspaper versions, it is imperative to examine the preferences and perception of readers for improved service delivery in the university library.

### *1.2 Objectives of the Study*
The general objective of this study is to determine readers’ perception and preferences for online and print newspapers in the university library. Specifically, the study is intended:
