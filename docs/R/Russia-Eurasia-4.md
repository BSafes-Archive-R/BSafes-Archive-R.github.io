## IV. Energy Law
### A. UKRAINE 

In 2016, Ukraine continued to implement the European Energy Community's Energy Directives with the primary goal of liberalizing the Ukrainian energy market. The ongoing conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine continues to significantly impact Ukraine's energy market and overall economy. Ukraine's main priority is improving its energy security, in part by increasing its own gas production. In late 2015, Tax Code reforms were adopted mandating decreases in gas production payments that were

enacted in 2014 and largely seen as unreasonable.<sup>105</sup> In addition, legislative amendments aimed at simplifying the process to obtain a license for gas production were developed.

Another very important development in the energy sector concerns the restructuring of Ukrainian oil and gas monopolist, the National Joint Stock Company (NJSC) Naftogaz, which will be carried out pursuant to a new law "On the Natural Gas Market"<sup>106</sup> and the Third Energy Package.<sup>107</sup> Unbundling gas transportation activity from gas production and supply should increase transparency in the sector and attract investment.<sup>108</sup> Investors are particularly interested in this reform because Ukrainian legislation provides that a foreign legal entity may own up to forty-nine percent of the operator of the Ukrainian gas transportation system. Another sign that Ukraine is opening its gas market is that a significant number of private traders entered Ukraine to import gas from Europe in 2016, demonstrating that Naftogaz no longer has a monopoly on importing gas. <sup>109</sup>

The Ukrainian electricity market underwent significant changes on September 22, 2016, when two important laws were approved by Parliament. First, Parliament adopted a law "On the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities" (NCSREU),<sup>110</sup> statutorily mandating the NCSREU's existence (as opposed to the previous situation of its existence only by regulation) in order to fulfill Ukraine's commitment as a party to the EU Energy Community. The law also set out a transparent

<sup>105</sup>. In 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted amendments to the Tax Code that reduced the payment for extraction of natural gas to be sold to industrial consumers (to be paid by natural gas producers) from fifty-five percent to twenty-nine percent, and twenty-eight percent to fourteen percent, depending on the extraction depth (effective Jan. 1, 2016), and reduced the payment for extraction of natural gas to be sold to households from seventy percent to fifty percent for extractions up to 5km deep (effective Apr. 1, 2016), which was further reduced to twenty-nine percent (effective Jan. 1, 2017). *Tax Rates for Natural Gas Production Significantly Decreased,* CMS LAW (Dec. 30, 2015), http://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2015/12/ukrainetax-rates-for-natural-gas-production-significantly-decreased.

<sup>107</sup>. As a member of the European Energy Community since February 1, 2011, Ukraine implemented European Union directives in the energy sphere (the so-called "Third Energy Package") by means of Directive 2009/73/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and Regulation (EC) 715/2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks.

On September 22, 2016, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine passed a resolution on the management of Naftogaz, which provided for the transfer of 100% shares of the company to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

procedure for appointing and rotating members of the NCSREU, ensuring that the regulator is professional, transparent, and independent. Second, Parliament approved an amendment to Ukraine's law "On the Natural Gas Market," which envisages a gradual transition from the current system of state-owned electricity purchaser<sup>111</sup> to a privatized model of operation using direct supply agreements, a market for "day-ahead" contracts, and a balancing market. These reforms will provide more transparency and healthier competition in the electricity market.

In mid-2016, the State Property Fund of Ukraine announced a new "oblenergo" (electricity supply company) sale schedule.<sup>112</sup> Currently, the State Property Fund of Ukraine is preparing for privatization of six electricity supply companies, three large hydro-electric power plants, and state co-generation power plants and coal mines.

Because Ukraine is an unusually large energy consumer, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) required the country to increase its tariffs on energy sources for private households to an economically viable level.] <sup>113</sup> Therefore, energy efficiency has become a more important issue in Ukraine, attracting investment from international financial institutions and Ukrainian banks, which provide financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Aiming to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy balance, last summer, despite Ukraine's economic crisis, the new government adopted legislative amendments demonstrating its support for the development of renewables. Consequently, the renewable energy sector, together with "green" tariffs, is still attractive for investors in Ukraine.

<sup>111</sup>. Historically, the state enterprise Energorynok bought all of the electricity produced in Ukraine (as a wholesale purchaser) and sold it to electricity supply companies (suppliers), which then sold it to customers. Purchased energy is sold by Energorynok to 27 oblast energy companies (oblenergo) and suppliers licensed to supply electricity with unregulated tariffs (as independent suppliers). Oblenergos sell electricity to final consumers with regulated tariffs. The new law allows power producers to sell their electricity directly to the suppliers through freely negotiated bilateral contracts, bypassing Energorynok entirely. Thus, the producer and supplier can mutually decide on the price, volume, and terms of the supply.

<sup>113</sup>. In 2015, the National Commission for State Regulation of Energy and Utilities passed a resolution providing for increased tariffs in five stages. See NCSREU Res. 220 (Feb. 26, 2015), *available at* http://www.nerc.gov.ua/index.php?id=14359. At a meeting on April 27, 2016, the Cabinet of Ministers set the unified gas price for the population at the level of UAH 6,879 per 1,000 cubic meters, effective May 1, 2016. The tariffs will constitute 100% of the "parity from import" price and will include inter alia the cost of gas transportation through pipelines and taxes. *See* Iuliia Ogarenko & Ivetta Gerasimchuk, *Winter Approaches: The Real Test for Ukraine's Energy Subsidy Reforms*, GLOBAL SUBSIDIES INrIAIVE (Sept. 1, 2016), https://www.iisd.org/gsi/news/winter-approaches-ukraine-subsidy-reforms#refl.
