## III. Public-Private Partnership Law
Private participation in the development of public infrastructure through public-private partnerships (PPPs) is currently a global trend, including in post-Soviet countries such as Russia and Belarus. According to UN data, over fifty percent of the world's population now lives in urban areas, and many countries are becoming increasingly urbanized.<sup>76</sup> This global

phenomenon is changing the landscape and infrastructure of many developing countries, and in 2016, lawmakers in Russia and Belarus modified their respective legislation on PPPs to facilitate improvements in the quality of life of their current and future residents.

### A. RUSSIA

Until recently, PPPs in Russia were governed by Federal Law No. 115-FZ "On Concession Agreements" (Concession Law), dated July 21, 2005,<sup>77</sup> which outlined the procedure for execution and implementation of PPPs in Russia at the federal level. The Concession Law allowed a concessionaire to develop and use a project which was or would be owned by the government, but allowed only for a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, whereby private investors could not acquire ownership of a PPP project. Several projects in Russia have been and continue to be executed using the- BOT model, including the Western High Speed Diameter toll road <sup>78</sup> and the Pulkovo Airport <sup>79</sup> in St. Petersburg.

On January 1, 2016, the new Federal Law "On Public-Private Partnership, Municipal-Private Partnership in the Russian Federation and Amending Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation" (Russian PPP Law) took effect.<sup>80</sup> Some provisions of the new Russian PPP Law are similar to the Concession Law, but there are some noticeable differences.

While the new Russian PPP Law will co-exist with the Concession Law, the Russian PPP Law allows for ownership transfer from the government to a private partner (usually a project-specific or single-purpose company) <sup>81</sup> Whereas the Concession Law allowed only one type of PPP structure (BOT), the new law significantly expands the forms of PPP structures in Russia. It allows, among others, Build-Own-Operate (BOO), Design-BuildOwn-Operate (DBOO), Design-Build-Operate-Transfer (DBOT), DesignBuild-Own-Operate-Transfer (DBOOT), and Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) structures. <sup>82</sup>

Under the Russian PPP Law, only a Russian legal entity may be a private partner in a PPP project, with the exception of certain other Russian entities such as state or municipal unitary enterprises or institutions, or non-profit

organizations created by the state or municipalities.<sup>83</sup> On the other hand, concessionaires under the Concession Law may be Russian or foreign legal entities, unincorporated partnerships, and sole proprietors.

The Concession Law allows the parties to a concession agreement to agree that disputes will be heard in Russian state courts or arbitration tribunals,<sup>84</sup> whereas the Russian PPP Law allows parties to a PPP agreement to choose any dispute resolution mechanism, presumably including arbitration by foreign tribunals.

In terms of financing and securing payments, the Concession Law does not allow concession projects to be pledged to a financing party, but a project developed under the Russian PPP Law may be pledged when a private partner secures the performance of its obligations under a separate agreement with the lender.<sup>85</sup> While there is a special tax regime for concession projects under the Russian Tax Code,<sup>86</sup> the Russian PPP Law does not contain any provisions relating to taxation. PPP projects most likely will fall under a tax regime created by different legal instruments (e.g., a combination of tax provisions in the Russian Tax Code, the Concession Law, and other tax laws and regulations relating to infrastructure projects).

### B. BELARUS

Unlike Russia, where infrastructure development has always been recognized as an important mechanism for economic growth, Belarus is only beginning to develop a legal framework regulating public infrastructure development. Belarus had no specific concession law before adopting its new law "On Public-Private Partnerships," which took effect in July 2016 (Belarusian PPP Law).<sup>87</sup> Before enactment of the Belarusian PPP Law, the Investment Code of the Republic of Belarus (Investment Code) regulated concessions.<sup>88</sup> Until passage of the Belarusian PPP Law, only mineral assets

could be offered for concession;<sup>89</sup> termination and compensation provisions of project agreements were not clearly regulated, and very limited sources of government support were available.<sup>90</sup> Thus, the Investment Code was an insufficient legal basis for the development of PPPs in Belarus, and the new Belarusian PPP Law was adopted to provide specific guidance.

Under the Belarusian PPP Law, PPPs can be developed in various sectors, including transportation, public utilities, health care, agriculture, education, culture, energy, and telecommunications.<sup>91</sup> The Belarusian PPP Law provides certain roles for the President of the Republic of Belarus, Council of Ministers, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and other governmental bodies.<sup>92</sup> It allows for transfer of infrastructure to a private partner for possession and use, although ownership rights remain with the government.<sup>93</sup> The Belarusian PPP Law sets the following stages for PPP project development:

1. Preparation, review and valuation of tender offers relating to PPP projects;

2. Decision relating to development of a PPP project;

3. Tender process by which a private partner for a PPP project will be selected; and

4. Execution and performance of the PPP agreement. <sup>94</sup>

The Belarusian PPP Law allows many agreement provisions to be negotiated freely between the parties, but some provisions are mandatory. For example, the governing law of the PPP agreement must be Belarusian law,<sup>95</sup> and the PPP agreement must be registered with the Ministry of Economy.<sup>96</sup>

Financing of PPP projects in Belarus may be done by a Belarusian or foreign entity in full or in part.<sup>97</sup> Private partners enjoy all guarantees generally provided to investors, including guaranteed money transfer and protection against nationalization.<sup>98</sup> The Belarusian PPP Law also provides guarantees for creditors of private partners.<sup>99</sup> In addition to litigation, international arbitration is one of the dispute resolution mechanisms provided by the Belarusian PPP Law.<sup>100</sup>

Initially, seven PPP pilot projects were planned in Belarus,<sup>101</sup> but only one transportation project is currently being developed: upgrading an 85- kilometer section of the M1O road, an international transportation corridor and alternate route between Belarus, the EU, Russia, and China.<sup>102</sup> As a result of the Belarusian PPP Law, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) are engaged in supporting this project. A private partner will design, build, operate, and maintain the motorway section, and in return, receive an "availability fee" from the Belarusian authorities.<sup>103</sup> The tender is expected to occur in 2017.<sup>104</sup>

Despite many unknowns, the Belarusian PPP Law and engagement of international organizations in the first PPP pilot project in Belarus provide an opportunity for global investors to assess regulatory and political risks for investment in Belarusian PPPs. While it is too early to analyze the effects of the new Russian PPP Law and the Belarusian PPP Law, it is important that PPPs in Russia and Belarus now extend beyond concessions. The new PPP laws provide universal terms and principles and an expanded list of acceptable PPP structures, as are found in PPP legislative frameworks in developed countries. The new PPP laws aspire to attract more private investors and funds to Russia and Belarus and to improve Russian and Belarusian infrastructure.
