## INTRODUCTION
It is the consensus that a robust manufacturing sector is essential to maintain the overall competitiveness of a nation. Major countries are investing heavily to modernize their manufacturing sector and gain an edge over the competition. Stock and Seliger proposed the concept of Industry 4.0 back in 2011 [1], which received extensive studies and was the first national strategy on nextgeneration manufacturing development. China’s *Made in China* 2025 plan is another significant effort in promoting future manufacturing. *Innovation 25* is Japan’s package program to empower the country’s economy through innovation and an open attitude, where improving Japan’s competitiveness in manufacturing is an important part of the program.

Although these efforts have different names, they share the same philosophy of increasing the investment of technology to improve the overall competitiveness of their manufacturing sector. One important investment direction of all these strategies is to develop new information and communications technologies (ICT) and to accelerate their integration with traditional manufacturing infrastructures, such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) for the industry. Most of these efforts aim at connecting the physical manufacturing infrastructure more closely with ICT and build closed and proprietary manufacturing infrastructures. The expectation is that the integration greatly improves manufacturing efficiency and reduces labor intensity or utilization at the same time. People are then freed from repetitive tasks and more time can be spent on creative activity. Based on the advancement in factory digitization, the concept of agile manufacturing was proposed [2], which focuses on enabling an organization to quickly respond to customer needs and market changes.

Originally, the integration of ICT and manufacturing infrastructure focused on each individual factory, where resource sharing is not a factor for consideration. This brings at least two limitations: (i) The information system invested in each individual factory is not fully utilized. The information system capability (e.g., computation and communication) is designed to handle the peak demand of a factory, and at other times the resources are wasted. (ii) Each factory is a silo. While a factory is equipped with an advanced information system and highly automated with precision operation capability, it does not have complete support for collaboration with other factories, especially for those who belong to other entities. As collaboration plays a more important role in modern manufacturing, this in turn limits the potential of each individual factory.

The isolation also brings other issues. For instance, modern manufacturing usually involves a global supply chain. That is, a single link on the chain without the most advanced configuration will limit the whole process. With factories becoming more sophisticated, it becomes harder for newcomers to jump on the competitive stage and may lead to monopolies, which in turn limits innovation.

The development of cloud computing sheds light to mitigate the above limitation, and the concept of *cloud manufacturing* was proposed [3]. In the paradigm of cloud manufacturing, instead of maintaining dedicated computation infrastructure for each factory, most of the computation and storage jobs are moved to the cloud computing infrastructure that is shared by multiple factories owned by different entities. Cloud manufacturing enjoys all the benefits of cloud computing from the perspective of information processing, for example, high flexibility, availability, scalability, and the pay-as-you-go service manner; and partially addresses the issue of waste of information processing resources.

As the deployment of the 5G mobile network increases, the resource-sharing between different factories is further improved. The 5G infrastructure enables various virtual technologies to support *network slicing*, which allows the network operator to build a virtual dedicated network with different features for a certain application scenario. It also offers a good option to replace dedicated and proprietary communication systems integrated with factories.

Besides leveraging cloud computing and 5G to improve the level of resource sharing, crowdsourcing [4] also becomes more popular in manufacturing. To accelerate new product development and to introduce innovative enhancements to existing ranges, there is an urgent need to utilize and share organizational and employee knowledge. Crowdsourcing offers a collaborative idea generation and problem solving mechanism. It allows one to obtain explicit knowledge from a broader community and extract previously unknown tacit knowledge in a less formal manner [5].

From the adoption of these technologies and methodologies, it can be seen that the trend for future manufacturing at least consists of two essential components, resources sharing and collaboration. Resource sharing reduces the idle time of the information system that is integrated with the manufacturing infrastructure, and provides a higher level of flexibility and resilience. At the same time, close collaboration accelerates manu facturing innovation and R&D.

**Figure 1.** Moving from current manufacturing infrastructure to the future software defined manufacturing infrastructure. Under the framework of software defined manufacturing, both information processing resources and physical manufacturing resources are shared by all practitioners, which not only improve the level of resource utilization, but also enable smoother and easier collaboration.

Along this direction, the landscape of manufacturing will continue to transform to further enhance resource sharing and collaboration. One promising approach is software defined manufacturing. *Software defined manufacturing* learns lessons from the key technologies from ICT, such as software defined network (SDN [6]) and software defined infrastructure (SDI [7]). The overall idea is to convert the infrastructures of certain manufacturing sectors to a unified, shared platform. Practitioners of that sector can schedule their work freely on the platform. The platform then allows practitioners to collaborate easily on all types of tasks to unleash the platform’s potential fully.
