## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**The Kremlin continues to deepen its reliance on the Russian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (ROC) as a lever of soft power in Russian foreign policy. Constitutional amendments ratified in July 2020 suggest that this church-state partnership is poised to grow stronger in the coming years. Recognizing that the ROC’s international undertakings function to echo Kremlin objectives, policymakers should consider scrutinizing church activities and interactions with civil society and government interlocutors, with an eye toward identifying and minimizing opportunities for Kremlin influence and interference.**

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
- The ROC has served as a steadfast soft power echo for Russian foreign policy interests during the Putin era, particularly as the Kremlin seeks to project an outsized vision of the “Russian world” beyond its national borders. 

- Constitutional amendments ratified in July 2020 are likely to bolster Kremlin foreign policy priorities in key areas: sovereignty and noninterference, the falsification of history, the rights of compatriots, and traditional values. 

- The ROC is poised to play an enlarged role in promoting these foreign policy objectives by conducting international outreach and advocacy, marshalling like-minded constituencies, exporting traditional values worldwide, and reinforcing key Kremlin narratives.
