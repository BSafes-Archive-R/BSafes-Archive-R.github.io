## Conclusion
The way that economic development impacts the degree of competence and the classification of skills as observed within the working class of the population has been a fundamental issue of social assessment of labor and work organization. One approach to look at this would be to acknowledge that technological development of the “advanced” industrial societies implies firmly more complex types of work tasks and therefore demands for a significantly higher level of skill. This results in a shift in the overall occupational structure of the workforce and also leads to skill increases within occupational categories and on the other hand, there is the “pessimistic” way which suggests that majorly, the inclination is towards a decline in the real “skill content” of jobs. The growth of non-manual or unassisted occupations has been accompanied by a profound internal transformation, as this type of work has become more central to production, it has been greatly automated, mechanized, and routinized. The automation undercuts traditional skills which reflects in the decline of pre-job training times. Companies and employees need to navigate the ever-changing technologies and organization leaders are tasked with reskilling and upskilling the workforce and preparing them for future demands. As recent trends design and change requirements of jobs, it is the individuals that are required to embrace this idea and motivate oneself to make learning a priority. Old notions of teaching with current circumstances and demands may be too slow and unsuitable to keep up with how rapidly the demands come up. Reskilling and upskilling will allow for survival in this ever-evolving technological space.
