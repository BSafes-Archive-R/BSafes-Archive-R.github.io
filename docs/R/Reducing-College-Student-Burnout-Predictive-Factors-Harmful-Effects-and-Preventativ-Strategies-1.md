## Reducing Collegiate Burnout - Predictive Factors, Harmful Effects, and Preventative and Curative Strat- egies 
The Twitter account @CollegeStudent showcases a unique hybrid of cartoon images, pop culture references, and random Internet videos to illustrate life as a 21st century college student. The account has amassed over two million followers, with hundreds of thousands of retweets and comments on posts about stress, lack of sleep, skipping one class to do homework for another, and living on free snacks from obscure campus events. Although these online snippets of student life are coated in satire, the content is driven by real, shared experiences representing what it means to be a college student—in a crude sense, to be overstressed, overtired, and underfunded.

For many young adults, entering the college years presents a sharp increase in independence and responsibility to meet a variety of intense and sustained demands. Such demands affect nearly all aspects of life: academic, psychological, social, financial, and emotional (Sarros & Densten, 1989). University upperclassmen and graduate students continue to experience the stress of balancing the demands of being a student (Jacobs & Dodd, 2003; McLuckie et al., 2018). While the profile of a stressed college student is a norm in the media and on campus, many studies have illuminated the negative effects of sustained or chronic stressors on physical and psychological health (Schneiderman et al., 2005). College students are expected to handle a variety of demands and are susceptible to the negative consequences of those sustained stressors.

The trend of psychological burnout, originally studied as a phenomenon in social-service workers, is now seen in university students. According to Schaufeli et al. (2002b), student burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, cynical attitudes toward other people and one’s studies, and feeling unable to achieve one’s academic goals. The categories of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal efficacy are concepts found in the popular Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) initially designed for use in the workplace. Burnout is reliably characterized by these three measures, as the inventory has been administered to people with various occupations, nationalities, and languages (Schaufeli et al., 2002a). Researchers have primarily focused on factors that mediate the relationship between demands and burnout, as not all who experience heavy workloads automatically experience the effects of burnout (Schaufeli et al., 2002b). However, little research currently exists on how to apply such findings to enhance student well-being.

The attention that the psychological community dedicates to student burnout is merited by its association with other mental illnesses, effects on future job performance, role in premature college exit, and overall negative impact on well-being (Cortes et al., 2014; May et al., 2018; Peterka-Bonetta et al., 2019; Salmela-Aro et al., 2011). Burnout is pathologically unique because many of the environmental factors that could be precursors to burnout are also key elements of engagement, which engagement is similarly characterized by intense effort and exertion in meeting the demands of one’s lifestyle (Stoeber et al., 2011). Fortunately, research on engagement and burnout has revealed that a student’s attitudes, traits, and coping strategies can predict whether their life demands will lead to engagement or burnout (Jacobs & Dodd, 2003). It is imperative that students recognize the symptoms of burnout in themselves and become educated on which coping strategies are most effective to prevent and reduce burnout.

While many universities have recognized the need for services dedicated to student well-being, they are becoming increasingly overextended with the rising number of students who seek psychological services (Center for Collegiate Mental Health [CCMH], 2020). Because academic burnout is a relatively new phenomenon in comparison to anxiety and depressive disorders and the environmental factors involved in burnout are common to most college students, there are few formal services that address burnout. Universities should mandate formal education about psychological burnout and teach valuable coping strategies for how to avoid it.
