## FOREIGN POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE 2020 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
Central among the constitutional amendments with potential implications for Russian foreign policy are provisions that entrench: a muscular vision of state sovereignty, a statesanctioned historical truth, the obligation to protect Russian compatriot rights abroad, and traditional values as a core component of Russian national identity.

### Boosting State Sovereignty
Russia’s Constitutional Court is now authorized to render unenforceable any international ruling against Russia—including from the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)—where it deems the decision to be contrary to Russia’s constitution and public order.<sup>5</sup> In addition, by requiring that Russia “tak[e] measures to…prevent interference in the internal affairs of the state,”<sup>6</sup> the constitution now provides fresh cover for the Kremlin’s global promotion of multipolarity.

### Prohibiting Falsification
Another amendment prohibits the spread of information questioning Russia’s official narrative regarding WWII. This prohibition has clear outward-facing implications for the projection of Russian power and civilization on the international stage. As Putin has cautioned, tarnishing Russia’s historical reputation is nothing less than “a threat to the fundamental principles of the world order.”<sup>7</sup> This newly constitutionalized imperative to combat falsification augurs a raft of international challenges, including condoning crimes committed under the Soviet occupation and amplifying the Kremlin’s ongoing disinformation campaigns.<sup>8</sup>

### Supporting Compatriot Rights
An additional amendment expanding government support to “compatriots living abroad in the exercise of their rights”<sup>9</sup> can also be linked to Russia’s projection of power abroad. The definitional fluidity attached to the term “compatriots” strengthens the case for a larger “Russian world” (*Russkiy mir*) outside of Russia proper that demands active Kremlin protection. This framing in turn amplifies Kremlin opportunities for expanding its political influence and intelligence-gathering abroad.<sup>10</sup>

### Enshrining Traditional Values
The traditional values-centric amendments serve to reinforce the Kremlin’s civilizational identity-building project and its related multipolarity campaign. Anchoring Russia’s national identity in these religiously steeped conservative values burnishes Russia’s bona fides as the vanguard of an anti-West coalition committed to contesting international human rights norms.<sup>11</sup> 

According to this narrative, only Russia can thwart the West’s effort to impose global “ultra-liberalism.” In Putin’s words, “efforts are being taken today to…destroy the traditional values….”<sup>12</sup> And this “clash of civilizations” poses a strategic threat to Russia’s geopolitical interests: “[P]romoting…LGBT [rights] and spreading the ideas of radical feminism… dilute[e] the values of family and marriage…. [such a] society…is a perfect target for socalled coloured revolutions.”<sup>13</sup>
