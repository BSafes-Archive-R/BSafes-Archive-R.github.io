Concept of Print Newspaper and Online Newspaper  
Newspaper Readership in Nigeria  
Causes of Shift from Print to Online Newspaper Readership   

### *2.1 Concept of Print Newspaper and Online Newspaper*
Print newspapers are news sources physical forms. They are newspapers that are produced in sheets of paper bound together. print newspaper is durable and can last for a long period of time. Online newspapers are web version of news sources, published and read over the World Wide Web or Internet. It is easily accessible and convenient. If you are running late to class or work but you want to take a look at the news, you probably aren’t going to make a trip to the library to read the print newspaper when you can look at the online version right away.

Online newspapers are one of the information sources available in a digital or virtual form, retrieval or access using computer technology and the Internet which may possess the same information contents as in print [12a]. It was posited that online newspapers might slightly substitute their print counterparts, but they do not seem to replace the entire potentials of the print versions vis-à-vis news and information contents [13]. In a study conducted in Salman, It was discovered in [14] that print newspapers remain an important source of information despite the availability and interactive nature of the internet, which becomes the most prevalent means of communication in recent years. Studies also show that the internet becomes the most effective and preferred medium for information [15]. Most of daily readers still prefer print newspapers to their online counterparts in terms of local popularity [16].

The influence of Internet on Nigeria news media has continued to grow wide such that one does not need to struggle to access information. Nigeria media organizations have already established a strong presence in cyber space amongst the pioneers are the Guardian Newspapers (www.ngrguardiannews.com), the This Day Newspaper group (www.thisdayon-line.com) the Independent Newspaper (www.newageon-line.com) and so on. It can be said therefore that the Nigerian media are measuring up with their counter parts in other parts of the world by maintaining strategic presence on information super high way [17].

Some Nigerian Universities have managed to set up an e-library to provide facilities and resources for accessing online newspapers such as computers with mobile internet access, digital recording devices, open access mobile telephones etc. Adoption of university e-library facilitates information dissemination and enables researchers, students, faculty members and the university to be more research driven. University e-libraries in Nigeria provide electronic and online resources for staff and students in order to enhance educational development and build formidable information society. Electronic library achieves its objectives by creating opportunities for the users to access and retrieve appropriate information that cater for their information needs with relative ease [18].

With availability of newspapers on the internet, which is viewed as a single system, consisting of interrelated systems; people can easily have access to news at a click [19]. The Internet World Stats of 2017 apparently clarifies that Nigeria, having 91.6 million internet users, is ranked the largest Internet country in Africa [1]

Most readers of the newspaper dailies are keying into this new trend and enjoying the luxury of being informed from any part of the world even at the comfort of their beds. In order to maintain their brand loyalists most of the well-known national dailies have established their presence in cyber space so as to always satisfy their yearning readers that are scattered across the globe.

### *2.2 Newspaper readership in Nigeria*
Given the continued quest for information, the average Nigerian reader looks up to the media in terms of the dissemination of news information, adverts and other related forms of print materials. The print, one of the forms of news sources has a dynamic way of attracting readership loyalist by its style of news reporting, judging from the past the newspaper industry in Nigeria has contributed immensely to the growth of the nation. It is the earliest form of journalism in which nationalists and the country’s founding fathers used to agitate their followership which led to the country’s independence.

However, the print media has always had a great readership size compared to the other forms of print papers in the country, because the citizenry or the average man in the country craves for information and newspaper being the oldest form of journalism still appeals to both the old and the young mostly the old. It was revealed in [20] that since the Internet was introduced, readership of print newspapers has slightly changed in Sweden and most obviously in Denmark, Norway and Finland. In the same vein, readership of online newspapers has significantly increased in the Western world. Despite the increase in online newspaper reading, some findings predicted bright future for print newspapers [21]. Studies also showed that print newspaper reading might considerably decline, especially at a time when people make internet the most relied-on source of information, but it is doubtful for online newspapers to absolutely replace or displace their print versions [22]. It seems to be true that those who heavily relied on the internet for information still read print newspapers.

Most elderly citizens prefer to get their news information from the national dailies other than the television or the radio because they are used to the trend due to the fact that during their early years in life, it was a trend. Notably the press has had had to grapple with the challenges of globalization, the internet especially as an emerging trend. Many readers in the Nigerian context don’t really take note of the attitudinal changes that occur within them they only look out for the information that is derived from the news source itself.

The online trend is now receiving much attention in the Nigerian society especially from the well to do citizens of the country. It is true that the new trend is fast gaining raves amongst the people of Nigeria, but the conventional newspapers still receive good attention from the readers that are not able to get close to any of the devices used in gaining access into the internet. Several studies conducted to examine the print and online newspaper readership in Nigeria. One of the studies include [23] who discovered that more than half of newspaper readers in Nigeria read online newspapers. This reveals that online newspaper accounts for more readers than the print newspapers in the country. In fact, online newspapers are gaining popularity in Nigerian [1]. On the contrary, it was revealed in [24] that print version of newspapers satisfy the information need of readers more than their online counterparts, adding that readers of online newspapers also read print versions. The cause of low readership of print newspapers in Nigeria may likely to be connected with the introduction of online newspapers, which provide news content to the readers for free [1].

Online news readership is fast becoming a growing trend. The findings in [25] show that newspaper publishers strive not to publish news only in online platforms as they realize that print is where is where attention of readers is more captured. Findings in [17] revealed that the internet is still evolving in Nigeria and is yet to reach the adoption levels already achieved in the western countries, as such online newspapers and their readership is yet to be fully embraced. More so, it is pertinent to note that the readership level of the print newspapers in Nigeria is fast declining based on the fact that the readers of this generation not only seek the content of the newspaper these days, they want more in terms of deriving comfort while reading.

The average Nigerian reader can now afford to go on-line to check his or her mailbox and still has the time and space to login into any of the available newspaper platforms and gather whatever information needed without spending much or exerting his or her strength towards getting the same information. For example, in Rhema University, personal observation shows that students seem to prefer getting information from the internet than reading a print newspaper copy. The number of internet users in Rhema University may have direct relationship with online newspaper readership. University students are becoming more enlightened and conversant with the internet, thereby increasing their flair in accessing news sources through it.

### *2.3 Causes of Shift from Print to Online Newspaper Readership*
Publisher do not completely focus on the online since print generate them good revenue. It was identified that the factor limiting the power of the internet to greatly expand the newspaper audience associate with socioeconomic reasons, which means the people who read the newspaper online are largely the same people who tend to read the paper in print [26].

In recent times, there is a significant shift from the newspaper readership towards online, this is attributed to a number of factors include the following:

#### *Cost:*
The cause of low readership of print newspapers in Nigeria may likely be connected with the introduction of online newspapers, which provide news content to the readers for free [1]. Print newspapers have relatively high fixed costs, costs associated with the press and the press operators are the same whether you are printing 100,000 newspapers or 150,000 newspapers as long as you have the capacity. This means that if you see a 10% decline in the costs of printing and delivering the newspaper. Newspapers generate most of their income advertising not subscription fees, advertisers decide how much to spend with whom based on the audience they are able to reach through the medium. As print newspaper readership declines, advertisers aren’t spending much money [26].

In recent times, there is an obvious tussle between online newspapers and print newspapers for a greater chunk of the reading population, it is however pertinent to note that according to Lorraine Lee (2008: 01). Though the decline in newspaper readership is most acute among the younger generations. Still, the older generation grew up with print newspapers and has for the most part stayed consistent in news consumption habits, on-line news consumption as with other types of online information is naturally and culturally appealing to generation x. not only is our generation going on-line for news but the internet has made converts out of core older generations as well [27].

#### *Timeliness and Convenience:*
Lee further noted that with new technology comes an impatient society in which people can source their news on their own terms, meaning when and where they want it. However, timeliness and convenience have become one of the key factors in people’s preference to read news online. People do not want to waste their time reading an article that is a day or even hours old, or have to go out of their way to find the closest news stand or wait for the morning paper to arrive. In addition to people’s busy schedules, reduced interest in news generally may also have contributed to the drop in print readership.

#### *Interactivity:*
The internet has led to a whole new wave of interactivity that print newspapers are unable to offer, this generation has become more outspoken and is looking to exchange and debate ideas rather than accept what news is given to them by the media. With newspapers the only interactivity readers have would be writing letters to the editor in hope of getting them published. With the internet, users can directly post comments on articles and electronically send in comments to the editor to generate discussion. When on-line users post the views on a topic, their ability to express their opinions make them feel like they are part of what shapes the presentation of news [26].

#### *Lack of Multimedia features:*
Multimedia features, lacking in print newspapers are another significant reason why readers go online for their news. Online stories provide readers with the opportunity to watch videos on the scene, and hear audio clips as well as experience first-hand other interesting visual that print newspapers cannot offer. Audience also seemed to have lost faith in print newspapers when compared to other media like television, where consumers can see the news. Multimedia online news is a step towards alleviating this problem [26].
