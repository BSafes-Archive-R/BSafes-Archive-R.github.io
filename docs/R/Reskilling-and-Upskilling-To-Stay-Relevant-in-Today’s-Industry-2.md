## Three societal trends and their implications
As the world witnesses technological advancements every single day, there are three main kinds of industries that need to be talked about, ones that are getting created in synchronization with the changes which definitely are the ones that are coming up with the need for new skills to be fully functional and operational and people who are yet to enter the job market need to realize the impact of the new industries that enter these sectors. A potential employee not only must be aware of the kind of expectations that the employers will have but must have the right skills for the kind of job they want to do. It is bizarre to expect for the candidate to be new-industry-ready after pursuing some bachelors or masters whose curriculum barely gets updated every year to cater for an industry that got created overnight. The cryptocurrency and blockchain industry are one such example. Blockchain was a brand-new technology when it was discovered. As a result, it is classified as an invention rather than a finding. It incorporates advanced mathematical principles as well as numerical methods. Blockchain is a system wherein data is saved in a way that it becomes next to impossible to alter, hack, or tamper with. It is a digital list of duplicated transactions that is distributed across the blockchain's entire network which is of different computer systems. Whenever a new transaction takes place using blockchain, a record of that transaction is provided to each participant and there is a fixed number of transactions allotted to each block that is a part of that network or chain. Meaning, if any of the blocks of the chain was changed, it would be apparent that it has been meddled with. If someone, say a hacker wanted to meddle with a blockchain system, it would require changing every single block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain itself. The use of blockchain makes it possible for you to have total control over your assets. Even though a public blockchain is autonomous and a private one requires some authentication it still greatly reduces the use and need of a centralized control since transactions are logged by an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash and only that. The identities of participants are either fully anonymous or partially. The use of blockchain is not only secure but has improved speed and efficiency. It solves various processes that are time consuming and automates transactions to maximize efficiency and thereby with the help of automation, eliminates human errors that tend to take place in these processes.

Secondly, there are industries which are getting disrupted. One disruptive technology is the introduction of Netflix and it’s streaming services, these made it possible for the consumer to get video on demand at the comfort of his or her home via delivery service and eventually a streaming medium. This led to the demise of many DVD rental stores and giants such as Blockbuster that once led the entertainment on-demand industry. Once Netflix started to offer its services, consumers found it inconvenient to make frequent trips to the nearest DVD rental store, at the same time not having the guarantee that the particular title that they wanted would even be there. Not only this, but the fact that one does not even need a set-up, a DVD player to stream. No need to download hence no need for storage, instant playback are all really big advantages. The convenience and ease of streaming via the internet allowed Netflix and other streaming sources to eventually take over.

Then there are those which are not harmed but only need to evolve for the better and people working in such industries are going to require better, more complex skills today to be able to do the same job tomorrow. Uber Technologies (UBER) is one of the most exciting firms to emerge in the last decade, thanks to its fast expansion and continual controversy. The global ridesharing app, which was launched in 2009, has gained a lot of traction. The app users can call on a car service from any location and have it arriving on demand, rather than chasing a cab on the street or contacting and waiting for a cab service. It made it incredibly simple for people to get a ride or hire a cab. The prices were made dependable and fixed according to the distance travelled and surge pricing due to peak hours. The drivers offering the cab services have registered their identities before getting access as an uber driver and so the cab you get from the uber app is not a random stranger on the street that you will normally have to travel with if you take a cab from the road, making uber a much reliable and safer option. This did not put cab drivers out of business; they just needed to become a part of the technological change.
