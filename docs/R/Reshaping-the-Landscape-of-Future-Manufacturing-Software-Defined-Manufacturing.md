***Abstract*—The prosperity of the manufacturing sector is critical for the overall competitiveness of a nation/region. Most of the existing efforts focus on the modernization and digitization of each individual factory, which can only bring isolated performance improvements and cannot optimize the ecosystem as a whole. A novel idea to overcome these limitations and keep improving the performance of the manufacturing sector is to enable horizontal scaling by breaking the silos and allowing more flexible resource sharing. Following this insight, we describe the concept of software defined manufacturing, which divides the manufacturing ecosystem into software definition layer (SDL) and physical manufacturing layer (PML). PML consists of a large number of unified manufacturing equipment and SDL takes care of all other jobs. Software defined manufacturing allows better resource sharing and collaboration, and has the potential to transform the existing manufacturing sector.
