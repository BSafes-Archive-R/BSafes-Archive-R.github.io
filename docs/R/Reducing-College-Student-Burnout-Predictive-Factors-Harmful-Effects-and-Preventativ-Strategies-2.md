## Burnout in College-Aged Young Adults
The demands and dynamism of young-adult life, especially college student life, justify studying burnout in students. Burnout was originally studied in older adults who were established in the workforce, but researchers began to notice that the pressures many college students face could also lead to burnout because school environments and work environments are comparably stressful (Vizoso et al., 2019). Given that burnout is considered a detrimental psychological and physiological condition, it is more likely to affect populations who are already compromised by other health challenges and life instabilities (Schaufeli et al., 2002b; Vizoso et al., 2019). Examining common young adult health challenges and the nature of burnout illuminates why college students are especially susceptible to burnout.
