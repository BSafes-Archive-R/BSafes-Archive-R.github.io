## Literature Review
According to Ovidiu and Peter (2013), it can be referred to the general idea of things, mostly everyday objects, which can be readable, recognizable, locatable and addressable through information sensing device and control through the Internet, regardless of the means of communication. Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the Internet where large numbers of “things”, such as sensors, actuators and processors, including human users, are networked and able to provide high resolution data on their environment and exercise a degree of control over it (Peter & Richard, 2017). Internet of things does not only include electronic devices as we see on daily basis such as vehicles and equipment but also include food, water, clothing, people, phones, chairs among others interacting with one another. Internet of things according to Keyur and Sunil (2016) is an internet of three things which include: people to people, people to machine /things, and things /machine to things/machine, interacting through internet. Laith, Rupak, Omprakash, Marcela, and Ali (2018) observe that IoT is a symbiosis of various technologies and is going to change drastically what can be achieved from the internet currently.
