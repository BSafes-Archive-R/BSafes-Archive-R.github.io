## CONCLUSION
Clinical data managed over IoT platforms are easily accessible over the internet and can be collected from different clinical institutes. The biggest challenge from the regulatory perspective would be the standardization of data management process across institutes, and development of regulations to define the procedures to be followed and the data standards. From security perspective, the biggest hurdle would be the planning and implementation of highly secured infrastructure that will protect the clinical data from hackers.
