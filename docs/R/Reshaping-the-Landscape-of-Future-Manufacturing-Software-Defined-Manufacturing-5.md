## CONCLUSION
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of the manufacturing sector for a country/region to flourish. Software defined manufacturing framework is based on, but further extends, existing R&D trends such as Industrial 4.0 and cloud manufacturing. The novel framework will transform the current manufacturing business model and pave the way for future manufacturing. It will bring many benefits that are not imaginable with today’s manufacturing infrastructures, such as innovation acceleration, better efficiency, and high resilience. Although there are still some temporary challenges to fully realize the framework, solid progresses have been made in most related directions and supporting technologies are becoming more mature.
