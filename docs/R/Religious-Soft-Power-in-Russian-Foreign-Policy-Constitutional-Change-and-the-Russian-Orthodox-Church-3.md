## CEMENTING THE ROC’S ROLE AS FAVORED SOFT POWER TOOL
The ROC has long rallied around advancing the now constitutionally enshrined vision outlined above. In embracing this mission, it has fortified the Kremlin’s campaign against the perceived civilizational threat posed by the West’s “mindless multiculturalism”<sup>14</sup> and peddled a vision of Russia “predestined to be the guardian of global balance, not merely in geopolitical but…in a moral/ethical sense.”<sup>15</sup>

### ROC Advocacy of Noninterference, Sovereignty, and Multipolarity
ROC diplomacy attests to an enduring commitment to the Kremlin’s preferred international order. In 1999, then Metropolitan Kirill lamented “new forms of confrontation in which…interference in the life of nations have been realized through political and economic actions.”<sup>16</sup> Kirill further asserted that: “Orthodoxy in international politics [could facilitate] the building up of a multipolar world.”<sup>17</sup> Nearly a quarter century later, the church’s framing of noninterference has led it to reject decisions emerging from the ECtHR and other human rights bodies as being alien and harmful to Russian sovereignty.<sup>18</sup> The ROC’s contemporary devotion to multipolarity remains equally undiminished, with one church leader recently speculating that the COVID-19 pandemic could help bring about “the real emergence of a multipolar world.”<sup>19</sup>

Most tellingly, however, the ROC’s wholesale embrace of Kremlin policy surrounding sovereignty and noninterference is revealed in the occasions when both actors appear willing to jettison principle in the name of realpolitik. Consider the Kremlin’s interventionist stance regarding Montenegro’s recently enacted Law on Freedom of Religion or Beliefs.<sup>20</sup> To validate its abandonment of non-interference, Russia’s Foreign Ministry proffered impressive verbal gymnastics: “We are categorically against any interference in internal affairs. [But this law]…could affect the interests of the Metropolitanate of Montenegro…[Therefore], it goes beyond national boundaries and concerns the unity and cohesion of the Orthodox World.”<sup>21</sup>

In this instance, Kremlin intervention cloaked in ostensible concern for the Orthodox world coincidentally seeks to diminish Western influence and advance Russia’s push for multipolarity. This decidedly secular motive has not deterred the ROC from reiterating the Kremlin’s temporal concerns and fueling the tension in Montenegro. In fact, the church has dutifully mobilized its various channels to echo Kremlin attacks on the new religious freedom law and the Montenegrin government more generally.

From Patriarch Kirill’s perspective, events in Montenegro are akin to a “Ukrainian scenario” that encroaches “on canonical Orthodoxy.”<sup>22</sup> As such, the matter is exempted from the niceties of noninterference. Revealingly, the patriarch’s invocation of a “Ukraine scenario” ties back to the Kremlin’s larger concern over Montenegro’s political alignment to the West. In the church’s words: “The current authorities of Montenegro do not conceal that they are active supporters of eurointegration and isolation from Serbia and for this reason they seek to discredit [our] common historical spiritual and cultural heritage.”<sup>23</sup> The prospect of a loss of Russian influence within this tiny country augurs so deep a blow to the Kremlin that the patriarch has gone as far as to insinuate that Montenegrin officials have subjected Orthodox faithful to torture.<sup>24</sup>

The ROC’s eagerness to intervene in Montenegro’s internal affairs directly serves Kremlin foreign policy by fueling Montenegrin political and social instability. On a still more sinister note, it also sows the seeds for potentially more egregious intervention from Moscow. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s declaration that Russia “will always defend the interests of Orthodox Churches,”<sup>25</sup> coupled with the freshly minted constitutional imperative to protect “compatriot” rights, leaves open the possibility of expanding the Kremlin’s compatriot umbrella to include non-Russian ROC-aligned believers.

The case of Montenegro signals that, like the Kremlin, the ROC will vociferously defend sovereignty to shield Russia and its allies from international scrutiny, but quickly discard the norm in the service of Russia’s foreign interests. The Kremlin’s decision to intervene in Syria provides another case in point. The church’s deafening silence in the face of credible reporting of war crimes linked to Russian military operations <sup>26</sup> in that country betrays the full extent of its unflinching support for the Kremlin’s selective grasp of international norms.

### The ROC as Guard Dog for Kremlin Truth
Over a decade ago, Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the ROC pledged to continue “joint efforts to combat the falsification of history.”<sup>27</sup> Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov renewed this vow in 2020, proclaiming that “the diplomatic service will continue to do its best to counter attempts to falsify history [through] close cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church.”<sup>28</sup> 

With falsification rendered constitutionally anathema, the church is poised to continue consecrating the Kremlin’s international push to brand as fascist any critic of Soviet glory. As part of this effort, the church advocates within the compatriot community abroad to nurture a shared vision of historical memory.<sup>29</sup> 

The church also wields the Kremlin’s historical narrative as a carrot and stick, both to build potential alliances and to exert pressure on less cooperative foreign governments. For example, the church recently lauded Croatian officials for restoring a memorial to Soviet soldiers, calling it “one of these profoundly symbolic actions which help preserve historical memory.”<sup>30</sup> In contrast, Patriarch Kirill directed a six-minute long harangue at the Bulgarian president for remarks Kirill deemed “outrages” of historical revisionism that depreciated the primary role of Russian state power and sacrifice.<sup>31</sup>

Through actions like these, the church energetically reinforces the Kremlin’s view that Russia’s reputation is sacrosanct, and that any perceived slight against it—including the “criminal war on monuments”<sup>32</sup>—is tantamount to the glorification of Nazism. In this context, as with the compatriot policy discussed below, the church can act without the diplomatic fetters that might otherwise bind Russia’s Foreign Ministry. Thus, Patriarch Kirill’s remarks in Bulgaria “aggressively push[ed] the Russian nationalist agenda…in a way that even the Russian Foreign Ministry avoids when dealing with what it considers ‘friendly’ nations.”<sup>33</sup> 

The church’s readiness to echo the Kremlin’s party line on the international stage extends beyond Russia’s WWII legacy. According to Sergei Lavrov, Russia “had accumulated great experience in ensuring the co-existence of people of various creeds” and “protect[ing] true religious values.”<sup>34</sup>  This statement expunges a checkered history of statesanctioned religious persecution and ongoing discrimination for the purpose of holding Russia out as an export-ready civilizational alternative to the West.

The church has embraced this disingenuous narrative unreservedly. In a speech delivered at the 2011 International Ecumenical Peace Convocation, Metropolitan Hilarion set aside Russia’s role in the production and dissemination of *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion* and the forcible expulsion of Muslim Tatars from Crimea to boast: “In Russia there have been no religious wars or religious confrontations in our history. People in our country have been able to find a language of mutual understanding…despite their differences in faith.”<sup>35</sup> 

### The ROC as Global Nexus for Cultivating Compatriots
Foreign Minister Lavrov has also lauded the church’s cooperation “helping the Russian diaspora and protecting the rights of Russians who have found themselves far away from the Homeland.”<sup>36</sup>  The church’s global network and deep involvement with other compatriotfocused organizations confirms its pivotal role in echoing Kremlin messaging to this constituency. For example, the World Russian People’s Council (WRPC), essentially a church-directed NGO, functions as a linchpin compatriot-networking organization that advocates Russian interests abroad, including through UN lobbying. Similarly, the church maintains formal cooperation agreements with a range of governmental organizations engaged in compatriot outreach and efforts to augment international support for Russian policy, including the Federal Agency for Compatriots Abroad and the Russkiy Mir Foundation.<sup>37</sup> 

Tapping into the ROC’s religious and cultural terroir provides the Kremlin with two significant advantages: First, the church promotes Kremlin messages without the baggage attached to more overtly statebacked outlets such as RT and Sputnik. Second, given the global breadth of church diplomacy, the Kremlin can access more diverse constituencies that transcend the narrow realm of compatriots. With the ROC operating as convenor of compatriots, other clergy, and foreign government officials,<sup>38</sup>  the Kremlin gains a seemingly neutral channel for actively informing and influencing global opinion on Russia.

The onset of a constitutional obligation to protect compatriot rights and interests also raises the possibility of passportization being extended to include to non-Russian Orthodox believers.<sup>39</sup>  If defending Russian civilization includes the protection of Orthodoxy, and the definitional fluidity of compatriots can flex to include “individuals who make the free choice of a spiritual, cultural, and legal link to the Russian Federation,”<sup>40</sup>  it may not be too great a leap to suggest that Moscow might seek to render Orthodoxy a basis for passportization to justify further foreign interventions in the name of Christian communities expressing affinity and support for Russia.<sup>41</sup> 

On a less extreme level, church outreach to other Orthodox “compatriots” hints at regions and countries where the Kremlin may seek to expand its influence using Orthodox ties as a bridgehead.<sup>42</sup>  From this perspective, the constitutional amendment on compatriots may signal additional fuel for Russian messianism and the Kremlin’s framing of the country and its civilization as the last bulwark against a godless world overrun by the corrupting influence of the ultra-liberal West.<sup>43</sup> 

### The ROC’s Crown Jewel: Spreading Traditional Values Everywhere
If the constitutional amendments discussed above merely infer an enlarged role for the ROC as a chief soft power exporter of the Kremlin’s foreign policy priorities, the amendments entrenching traditional values render this role inescapable. At least in part directly attributable to the ROC’s lobbying,<sup>44</sup>  the traditional values amendments enshrine the church’s function as guardian of Russia’s spiritual and moral identity.

Infusing these values with newfound constitutional status reinforces the likelihood that they will be disseminated globally to oppose Western “ultra-liberalism” and shore up the Kremlin’s campaign for greater international influence. Notably, the church has portrayed traditional values as under siege for longer than the Kremlin, and without any pretense of diplomatic nicety: “It may well be…that the entire Western civilization…is becoming radically anti-Christian and antireligious. In this case there is a need of not only a pan-European but also of a universal common front formed by traditional religious confessions in order to repel the onslaught of militant secularism.”<sup>45</sup> 

To help strengthen Russia’s global position, the church has reached out to a range of religious constituencies and courted conservative activists, compatriots, simpatico foreign governments, and political operatives. Through these efforts, the ROC staunchly opposes any perceived encroachments on traditional values while simultaneously promoting the Kremlin’s international leadership as the most effective guardian of these values.

For example, the church’s engagement with other “fraternal” churches often seeks to undercut Western institutions from within. In one visit to Bulgaria—an EU member state—Patriarch Kirill used a meeting with the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to urge Bulgarians to reject the EU for imposing “behaviours believed to be sinful by Christians and ethically unnatural.”<sup>46</sup>  The ROC similarly invokes traditional values to build common ground with other non-Orthodox religious faiths. As one human rights organization concluded, this “unholy alliance” unifies “traditionalist actors from Catholic, evangelical, Mormon…and Muslim faith backgrounds” to “[attempt] to revert feminist and sexual rights gains at the international level.”<sup>47</sup> 

The 2016 Havana Declaration, signed by the ROC and the Vatican, exhibits this latter type of outreach, while illustrating the ROC’s use of traditional values to validate Kremlin foreign policy. Among other things, the declaration laments secularization; calls attention to endangered Christian communities in the Middle East; and offers up generic pleas for peace in Ukraine, Syria, and elsewhere.<sup>48</sup>  But it painstakingly avoids any direct criticism of Russia. Instead, the declaration promotes a view of the ROC and Kremlin as neutral peacemakers committed to protecting endangered Christians, and positions the Vatican as condoning Russia’s foreign adventurism.

The church’s ability to invoke traditional values as a vehicle for garnering support for Russian policy is similarly reflected in its outreach to conservative civil society groups, leaders from across Europe, and “their comrades from the American heartland.”<sup>49</sup>  For example, C-Fam, a U.S.-based “pro-family” NGO, has fawned over the ROC’s rejection of a UNICEF brief calling for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.<sup>50</sup>  Elsewhere, the International Organization of the Family has sought to boost ROC and Kremlin policies, accepting Kremlin-connected Orthodox oligarch funding,<sup>51</sup>  endorsing “a very prominent role [for Russia]…on a global scale,” <sup>52</sup>  and celebrating Russia as “the Christian saviors of the world.” <sup>53</sup>
