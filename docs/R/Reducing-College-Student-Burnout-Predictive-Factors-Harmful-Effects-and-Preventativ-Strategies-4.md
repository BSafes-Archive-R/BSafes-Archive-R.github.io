## Health Challenges in Young Adults
Many studies have found that college students are vulnerable to psychological and physiological illnesses (Jacobs & Dodd, 2003; Law, 2007; Williams et al., 2018). Stress is defined as the body’s physiological and psychological response to internal or external change (American Psychological Association [APA], 2020), and current research shows that young adults are typically more stressed than children or the elderly (APA, 2012). Although short-term stress can be helpful in physiological performance and mental concentration, the harmful effects of long-term stress are well-documented in published literature. These effects include immune system depression, lower-quality sleep, increased strain on interpersonal relationships, and lower academic performance (Law, 2007; Schneiderman et al., 2005; Towbes & Cohen, 1996). Stress is also thought to be related to mental illness, which is becoming increasingly prevalent among college-aged students (CCMH, 2020). According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI, 2019), the median age of onset for mental disorders ranges from late teens through early 20s, and most lifelong mental illnesses are diagnosed by age 24. This indicates that people may be more likely to experience high stress or develop mental illness in their college years than in other stages of life, which could increase their susceptibility to developing comorbidities.
