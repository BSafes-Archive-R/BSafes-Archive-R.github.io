## INTRODUCTION
In January 2020, President Putin surprised Russians and the world by proposing a sweeping set of constitutional reforms. Despite an emphasis on domestic policy and the welfare state, the push for amendments signaled a distinct preoccupation with Russia’s international standing. Putin’s proposed reforms began by asserting that “Our nation’s sovereignty must be unconditional…Russia has returned to international politics as a country whose opinion cannot be ignored.”<sup>1</sup> Propelled by this outward-facing orientation, Putin’s first suggested amendments sought to curb the domestic impact of any decisions taken by international bodies regarding Russia’s international obligations.

Putin’s traditional allies were quick to embrace his invitation to propose further amendments. Among others, Patriarch Kirill, head of the ROC, suggested believers should “pray and work so God would be mentioned in our foundational law.”<sup>2</sup> President Putin answered these prayers by endorsing Kirill’s proposal and bundling it into the list of revised amendments delivered to the State Duma in March 2020.<sup>3</sup> Within a matter of days—and with virtually no opposition— Putin’s package of amendments secured the approval of various government bodies. In July 2020, citizens overwhelmingly endorsed the amendments in a public vote,<sup>4</sup> thus blessing the largest overhaul of the Russian constitution since its original ratification in 1993.

The approved constitutional amendments cover wide ground, ranging from social and welfare benefits to reorganization of the state’s political power structure. But lost in this torrent of reform are certain key amendments that also harbor significant implications for Russian foreign policy.
