## Abstract
Academic burnout is defined as experiencing emotional exhaustion, having cynical attitudes toward other people and one’s studies, and feeling unable to achieve one’s academic goals (Schaufeli et al., 2002b). Academic burnout has been observed among college student populations, and its prevalence is increasing as college students are more susceptible to psychological illness, are experiencing peak levels of life stress between ages 18 and 33, and are learning to handle novel demands associated with emerging adulthood (APA, 2012; NAMI , 2019). Internal factors, such as motivational style, attitude, and coping mechanisms, have been shown to mediate the relationship between demands and burnout (Gan et al., 2007; Vizoso et al., 2019). Universities that create burnout prevention programs based on development of soft skills to help students process demands in healthy ways may decrease the number of students who need curative psychological services and contribute to the overall well-being of their students long after graduation.
