## II. Arbitration and Civil Procedure
### A. RUSSIA

Reforms to the Russian arbitration system were enacted by Federal Law No. 382-FZ "On Arbitration in the Russian Federation" (Law 382-FZ)<sup>11</sup> and the related Federal Law No. 409-FZ "On Amending Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation" (Law 409-FZ).<sup>12</sup> These new laws have

significantly affected domestic and international arbitration in Russia. Law 382-FZ replaced the existing law on domestic arbitration,<sup>13</sup> while Law 409- FZ brought existing laws, including the Law on International Commercial Arbitration (ICA Law),<sup>14</sup> the Arbitrazh Procedural Code,<sup>15</sup> and the Civil Procedure Code,<sup>16</sup> into conformity with Law 382-FZ. The bulk of both laws took effect on September 1, 2016, with some provisions taking effect later.<sup>17</sup>

While updating the general arbitration framework, these reforms significantly impact the status of *ad hoc* arbitrations and streamline important issues pertaining to arbitrability of corporate disputes.

Under the previous version of the ICA Law, parties generally could refer the following types of disputes to international commercial arbitration: 

(1) contractual or other civil law disputes arising from the parties' international economic activity, where at least one of the parties has a commercial enterprise abroad; 

(2) disputes between enterprises with foreign investments, international associations, and organizations established in Russia; and 

(3) disputes between the participants of the entities listed in (2) and other parties.

The updated ICA Law expands this list to include disputes where a substantial part of the obligations arising from the relationships between the parties is to be performed abroad, or where the subject matter of the dispute is most closely connected with a foreign state. It also extends the scope of disputes pertaining to international investment that may be made subject to international commercial arbitration.<sup>18</sup>

International arbitration institutions such as the International Commercial Arbitration Court (ICAC) and the Maritime Arbitration Commission (MAC) at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation may consider domestic disputes, but examination of such disputes will be governed by domestic arbitration law.<sup>19</sup>

Law 382-FZ introduces new rules for the creation and functioning of arbitration institutions. Such institutions may be created only under the auspices of non-commercial organizations and are required to obtain permission from the Russian Government,<sup>20</sup> although the law exempts the ICAC and the MAC from this requirement.<sup>21</sup> Arbitration awards rendered by arbitration institutions without permission will be treated as decisions made by an *ad hoc* arbitration.<sup>22</sup>

*Ad hoc* arbitrations are subject to a number of new limitations, including the following: 

1. A party cannot waive its right to petition to a Russian court regarding the recusal of an arbitrator,<sup>23</sup> termination of an arbitrator due to inability to perform his or her duties,<sup>24</sup> a challenge to a jurisdictional ruling<sup>25</sup> or revocation of an award;<sup>26</sup>

2. Assistance from the Russian court in collecting evidence is not allowed;<sup>27</sup> and 

3. *Ad hoc* arbitrations cannot decide corporate disputes.<sup>28</sup>

Importantly, corporate disputes may be considered only by institutional arbitration.<sup>29</sup> Law 409-FZ generally covers which corporate disputes are arbitrable<sup>30</sup> and identifies some corporate disputes that must meet additional requirements in order to become arbitrable.<sup>31</sup> Other specific types of corporate disputes cannot be subject to any arbitration, including:

1. Disputes related to convening general meetings of shareholders/ participants or expelling participants;<sup>32</sup>

### B. KAZAKHSTAN

The Kazakhstan Civil Procedure Code (Civil Procedure Code or Code) took effect on January 1, 2016.<sup>39</sup> While retaining basic concepts of the previous code, the revised Civil Procedure Code introduces significant new items relating to trial procedure. One of the most important changes is a transition from the previous five-level judicial system <sup>40</sup> to a three-level judicial system comprised of courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and courts of cassation.<sup>41</sup>

The Civil Procedure Code provides that investment disputes42 are under the jurisdiction of the court of Astana;<sup>43</sup> however, if a party to an investment dispute is a "large investor,"<sup>44</sup> then the investment dispute is subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan.<sup>45</sup> The Code also encourages dispute resolution by amicable means. For instance, a judge is obliged to encourage the parties to reconcile a dispute at all stages of civil procedure.<sup>46</sup> A conciliation process called the "participative procedure" was established and is to be conducted with the assistance of the parties' attorneys through negotiations without the judge's intervention.<sup>47</sup>

The Civil Procedure Code also introduced a new, shorter written court procedure,<sup>48</sup> which is like an ordinary proceeding but is simplified and conducted without the adversarial parties present.<sup>49</sup> Only specific categories of cases may be resolved through this type of proceeding.<sup>50</sup> Another change regards the tendering of evidence to the court. Currently, evidence is tendered at the preparatory stage of litigation <sup>51</sup> and also may be proffered at the judicial examination stage if the proffering party was unable, for justifiable reasons, to provide it at the preparatory stage. <sup>52</sup> But the Civil Procedure Code now mandates that a number of procedural actions, such as filing a counterclaim,<sup>53</sup>" amending a claim,<sup>54</sup> and increasing or reducing claims,ss may occur only at the preparatory stage.

preparatory stage has been lengthened from seven business days <sup>56</sup> to fifteen business days,<sup>57</sup> and in extraordinary circumstances, it may be extended up to one month.<sup>58</sup>

The Civil Procedure Code established a cap on reimbursement for legal representation costs at ten percent of the adjudicated amount in the case of material (property) claims, and no more than 300 MCIs <sup>59</sup> in the case of moral (non-property) claims.<sup>60</sup> In addition, new rules for calculating the state fee (i.e., filing fees and court costs) were established for claims of moral harm caused by the dissemination of information discrediting one's honor, dignity and business reputation (similar to Western concepts of libel and slander). Prior to the enactment of the Civil Procedure Code, the state's fee for such claims was fifty percent of MCI,<sup>61</sup> but now is one percent of the recovery requested for individualS <sup>62</sup> and three percent for legal entities.<sup>63</sup> The Civil Procedure Code does not require the payment of a state fee for filing an appeal petition, but the state fee is required when filing a cassation petition.

The Civil Procedure Code also changed the effective date of a judgment from a court of first instance. Whereas the Old Civil Procedure Code allowed fifteen days for appeal following the issuance of a court judgment,<sup>64</sup> as a general rule, the Code now provides that a court judgment comes into force one month after the date on which the judgment was awarded in its final form.<sup>65</sup>

The Civil Procedure Code expanded the powers of the courts of appeal as well. For example, a court of appeals now has the right to overturn a judgment and remand a case for reconsideration by a court of first instance in any of the following circumstances:<sup>66</sup> a case was considered by an improper composition of a court or in violation of jurisdictional rules;<sup>67</sup> a

case was considered by a court of first instance in violation of the rules regarding language of court proceedings;<sup>68</sup> a court of first instance resolved a case regarding the rights and obligations of third parties not involved in the case; <sup>69</sup> or a judgment either was not signed by a judge or was signed by a judge who did not hear the case. <sup>70</sup>

The procedural rules for cassation courts have also undergone major changes. Generally, a cassation petition may be filed within six months of a judgment's effective date.<sup>71</sup>' But if the procedure of appeal to the cassation court is improperly followed by a party, it is unlikely that the case will be considered by the cassation court.<sup>72</sup> According to the Civil Procedure Code, the following types of cases also cannot be considered by a cassation court:

1. a case considered through a simplified civil procedure;

2. a case settled by settlement agreement, mediation agreement, or participative agreement; 

3. a case abandoned by the renunciation of the claim; 

4. a case for material claims over 2000 MCIs for individuals and 30,000 MCIs for legal entities; 

5. a case regarding the settlement of the insolvency of a debtor; and 

6. a dispute arising from rehabilitative procedure and bankruptcy.<sup>73</sup>

But the Code establishes that the last two categories above (as well as certain other types of cases), regardless of appellate proceedings, may be considered by a cassation court at the behest of the Chairman of the Supreme Court and the General Prosecutor <sup>74</sup> if a judgment may cause irreversible harm to the lives and health of the people, economy, and/or security of Kazakhstan, violate the rights and lawful interests of an indefinite number of people or other public interests, or violate the uniform interpretation and application of laws by the courts. <sup>75</sup>
